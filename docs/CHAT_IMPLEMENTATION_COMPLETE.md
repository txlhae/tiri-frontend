## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Chat Room Creation Pattern**
All implementations use the existing pattern:
```dart
final chatController = Get.put(ChatController());
final roomId = await chatController.createOrGetChatRoom(
  currentUserId,
  targetUserId,
  serviceRequestId: requestId, // Optional for service context
);
```

### **Navigation Pattern**
Consistent navigation to chat:
```dart
Get.toNamed(
  Routes.chatPage,
  arguments: {
    'chatRoomId': roomId,
    'receiverId': targetUserId,
    'receiverName': targetUsername,
    'receiverProfilePic': targetProfilePic,
  },
);
```

### **Error Handling**
- Loading dialogs for chat room creation
- Error snackbars for failures
- Proper cleanup of loading states
- User-friendly error messages
