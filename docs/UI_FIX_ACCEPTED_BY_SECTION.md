# üîß UI Fix: "Accepted By" Section Visibility

## üêõ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
The "Accepted By" section was incorrectly showing for **both** requesters and volunteers, causing UX confusion.

### **Original Condition (WRONG):**
```dart
if (request.acceptedUser.isNotEmpty &&
    (request.userId == currentUserId || request.acceptedUser.any((user) => user.userId == currentUserId)))
```

This showed the section when:
- ‚úÖ User is the requester (`request.userId == currentUserId`) ‚Üê **WRONG**
- ‚úÖ User is an accepted volunteer (`acceptedUser.any(...)`) ‚Üê **CORRECT**

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Fixed Condition:**
```dart
// "Accepted By" section - Only show for volunteers, not requesters
if (request.acceptedUser.isNotEmpty &&
    request.acceptedUser.any((user) => user.userId == currentUserId))
```

Now the section **ONLY** shows when:
- ‚úÖ User is an accepted volunteer (`acceptedUser.any(...)`) ‚Üê **CORRECT**
- ‚ùå User is the requester ‚Üê **REMOVED**

## üéØ **IMPACT**

### **Before Fix:**
- **Requesters** saw "Accepted By" section showing themselves and other volunteers
- **Volunteers** saw "Accepted By" section showing all accepted volunteers
- Confusing UX: Why would a requester see "Accepted By" themselves?

### **After Fix:**
- **Requesters** no longer see the "Accepted By" section
- **Volunteers** still see "Accepted By" section with all accepted volunteers
- Clear UX: Volunteers can see who else was accepted for the same request

## üìÅ **FILE MODIFIED**
- `lib/screens/request_details.dart` - Line 435-436

## üß™ **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **For Requesters (Request Owners):**
- [ ] "Accepted By" section should NOT appear
- [ ] Volunteer management section should still work
- [ ] Chat buttons with volunteers should still work

### **For Volunteers (Accepted Users):**
- [ ] "Accepted By" section SHOULD appear
- [ ] Should show all accepted volunteers for the request
- [ ] Profile and chat buttons should work within the section

### **For Non-Involved Users:**
- [ ] "Accepted By" section should NOT appear
- [ ] Should only see basic request details

## üîç **VERIFICATION**
The fix ensures proper role-based visibility:
- **Requesters**: See volunteer management tools but not "Accepted By"
- **Volunteers**: See who they're working with via "Accepted By"
- **Others**: See basic request info only

This creates a cleaner, more logical user experience for each user type.
